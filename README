AviSynth, as an MSVC-based project, does not have a 'make install'
routine that users familiar with GNU-style build systems recognize.
Thus, users must search out the avisynth_c.h header from AviSynth's
source code and manually copy it to wherever their source code
expects it to be.

As a remedy for this issue when wanting to build libav with
--enable-avisynth, this repo provides a copy of these headers
to facilitate ease of install.

To install:
make install

To install to a non-standard location:
make install PREFIX=/path/to/location

To uninstall:
make uninstall
